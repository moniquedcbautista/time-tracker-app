# ðŸ•’ TimeTracker App

**TimeTracker** is a simple yet effective web-based time logging application designed for employees or individual users who need to track their daily working hours. It allows users to log in securely using Supabase authentication and record their work hours using a clean, button-based interface.

The application automatically captures the current time when the user clicks **Time In** and later **Time Out**, storing each session in a Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL database. A user-friendly dashboard displays the user's current login status, session summary, and a list of all past entries.

This project was built using:
- **React** and **Vite** for a fast and modern frontend development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Supabase** for managing authentication and storing user time logs
- **Vercel** for deployment and hosting

Itâ€™s ideal for internal use, freelance work tracking, or small teams who need a lightweight time management tool without the complexity
